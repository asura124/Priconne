# Priconne

With the surprised closing of Priconne Global by Crunchyroll, many people have decided to move to the JP version of the game to continue playing. However, by moving to the JP version, there are many difficulties, most noticeably is the language: Not being able to read what a unit does or what the characters are saying. 

The purpose of this discord bot is to allow users to search up a unit within the game and easily read what they do: Union Burst, Skill 1, Skill 2, EX skills, their initial movement, and attack cycle.
